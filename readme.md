# JVC Projectors Home Assistant Integration

# Archived
> [!WARNING]  
The latest HA release removed setup functions this integration uses. I don't have the time to rewrite this integration. Please use the offical integration from now on https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/jvc_projector/

I will eventually get around to adding features to the official one.



This is a Home Assistant JVC Custom Component implementing my [JVC library](https://github.com/iloveicedgreentea/jvc_projector_python)

## Features

All the features in my [JVC library](https://github.com/iloveicedgreentea/jvc_projector_python) including:

- Power
- Picture Modes
- Laser power and dimming
- Pretty much every JVC command
- HA Attributes for current settings like power state, picture mode, laser mode, input, etc
- and so on


Note: JVC projectors currently only support a single network connection at a time. If you're running other control systems or attempt to run the JVC AutoCal software, keep in mind you can only have one control system connected at a time.

## Installation

This is a custom component.

Install HACS, then install the component by adding this as a custom repo
https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories

You can also just copy all the files into your custom_components folder but then you won't get automatic updates.

### Home Assistant Setup

```yaml
# configuration.yaml
remote:
  - platform: jvc_projectors
    name: { entity name }
    password: { password } (optional for non-NZ)
    host: { IP addr }
    new_model: false | true (true if you have NZ800/900 or newer)
```

The new_model flag is now required because JVC made a breaking change to how the password is encoded. Because I can't know the model before connecting, you have to tell the library to handle the password differently.

You can use the remote entity attributes in sensors, automations, etc.

### Adding attributes as sensors

replace nz7 with the name of your remote entity
```yaml
sensor:
  platform: template
  sensors:
    jvc_installation_mode:
        value_template: >
            {% if is_state('remote.nz7', 'on') %}
              {{ states.remote.nz7.attributes.installation_mode }}
            {% else %}
                Off
            {% endif %}
```

## Usage

Use the `remote.send_command` service to send commands to the projector. 

`$command,$parameter`
example: "anamorphic,off"
example: "anamorphic,d"
example: "laser_dim,auto3"

It also supports using remote codes as ASCII [found here](https://support.jvc.com/consumer/support/documents/DILAremoteControlGuide.pdf) (Code A only)

example: "remote,2E"

```
